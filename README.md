Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain Model

**itmlogic** is a Python implementation of the Longley-Rice propagation model (v1.2.2) and
capable of estimating the propagation effects resulting from irregular terrain.

Model properties and the algorithm defining it are available in:

* Hufford, G. A., A. G. Longley, and W. A. Kissick (1982), A guide    to the use of the ITS
  Irregular Terrain Model in the area prediction mode, NTIA Report 82-100. (NTIS Order No.
  PB82-217977)
* Hufford, G. A. (1995) The ITS Irregular Terrain Model, version 1.2.2, the Algorithm.


## Setup and configuration

All code for ``itmlogic`` is written in Python (Python>=3.6).

See requirements.txt for a full list of dependencies.


## Conda

The recommended installation method is to use conda, which handles packages and virtual
environments, along with the conda-forge channel which has a host of pre-built libraries
and packages.

Create a conda environment called ``itmlogic``:

    conda create --name itmlogic python=3.7 gdal

Activate it (run this each time you switch projects):

    conda activate itmlogic

First, install optional packages:

    conda install numpy fiona shapely rtree rasterio pyproj tqdm pytest

Then install itmlogic:

    pip install itmlogic

Alternatively, for development purposes, clone this repository and run:

    python setup.py develop

Run the tests:

    pytest


## Background

The model was developed by the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) for frequencies
between 20 MHz and 20 GHz (named for Anita Longley & Phil Rice, 1968), and as a general
purpose model can be applied to a large variety of engineering problems. Based on
both electromagnetic theory and empirical statistical analyses of both terrain features and
radio measurements, the Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain Model predicts the median attenuation
of a radio signal as a function of distance and the variability of signal in time and in space.
